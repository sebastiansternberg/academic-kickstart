I use two different methods to approach this: a dictionary extension using *word embeddings* and a deep learning classifier relying on *recurrent neural networks*. Currently, I am in the process of annoting the necessary data for validation and building the classifier. The goal is to use the measure that turns out best for the vagueness paper."
