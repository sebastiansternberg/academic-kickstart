**Testimonials:**

> Awesome  tutor,  probably  the  best  course  I  had  so  far  combined  with  the  lecture.  Really  great  job,  always  explained everything  with  calm  in  non-technical  terms  that  also  non-statisticans  understand.

> Maybe  the  most  motivating  learning  environment  I  have  yet  experienced!

> This  was  actually  one  of  the  best  and  most  interesting  courses  I  ever  had  during  my  university  career!  I  really  liked attending  the  course  and  learned  a  lot.  The  lecturer  was  very  friendly,  patient  and  always  helpful.  During  the  course, his  office  hours  and  even  via  email  he  was  always  available  and  helped  to  solve  even  very  complicated  topics.  That made  the  quite  difficult  and  sometimes  very  exhausting  weekly  problem  sets  bearable.  I  got  the  impression  that  the lecturer  was  very  motivated  and  always  well  prepared.  Well  done!
