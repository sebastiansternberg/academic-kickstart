# Biography

I am a third-year PhD Candidate and Research Associate at the Department of Political Science, Chair for 
Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences at the University of Mannheim. I am interested in the application of machine learning approaches to political science questions, with a particular focus on predictive modelling and text analysis. 

My work includes, for instance, the prediction of constitutional court decision-making with a machine learning classifier and the development of a deep learning classifier to analyze vagueness in judicial texts. Recently, I also started to give workshops in *R*, for instance a Machine Learning/Deep Learning Workshop at the *Deutsche Bundesbank* or an Introduction to *R* Workshop at the *Geschäftstelle Qualitätssicherung Hessen*.
