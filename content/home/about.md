# Biography

I am a third-year PhD Candidate and Research Associate at the Department of Political Science, Chair for 
Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences at the University of Mannheim. I am interested in using machine learning approaches for the analysis of political science questions, with a particular focus on predictive modelling and text analysis. 

My work includes, for instance, the prediction of constitutional court decision-making and the development of a classifier to detect strategical vagueness in judicial texts using deep learning. Recently, I also started to give workshops in *R*, for instance for the *Bundesbank* (Unsupervised Machine Learning) and the *GQH* (Introduction to R).
